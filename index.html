<h1> This Is What Peak Fiction Looks Like </h1>

<p> Stories. They're an endless constant medium that spans across the entire world to connect millions of people to one another regardless of the language barrier. They come in many different forms, from good old fashioned books, to manga, to movies and shows. There are thousands of stories we've seen, both good and bad, but what exactly defines these "good" stories? What do we look for in a story, and what does "peak" fiction really look like?

<h2>The Elements of a Story</h2>

<p>Of course, what we look for in a story depends on what type of story we're looking for, and also the personal taste of the person. But in general, what are some of the elements that make a story great? What specifically captures the heart of millions of people about the story of One Piece?
<ul>
<li>Characters</li>
<li>Story</li>
<li>World</li>
<li>Buildup</li>
<li>Believability</li>
</ul>
<p> These are just some of the things that a great story excel at. So does One Piece do these well? Which of these is in particular is the greatest aspect of the story that hooks people to this story so well? Let's take a look at these aspects of the story.
<hr>

<h2>The Characters</h2>
<a href="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/de/b9/05/deb90534834859473699f94c084c6888.jpg" target="blank">

</a>
<p>The characters are one of the most important aspects of a story, and we can see this in full affect in One Piece with some of the fan favorites... and, well, not so favorites. One Piece has a vast array of characters, some more relevant than others. Each of the characters are unique, with different endearing traits. No story is good unless you have a protagonist you can get behind, and One Piece does just this. Monkey D. Luffy, is the hero of our journey. While at first he might give you the impression of an ordinary Shounen anime protagonist, Oda still manages to captivate you with this compelling protagonist regardless of the common tropes. Although Luffy has the common traits of a Shounen protagonist (impulsive, dumb, strong, stubborn), the sheer drive and empathy he displays makes you just want to cheer him on on his ventures. He's different from other Shounen protagonists in the way that he is flawed. Though he often might barrel through the story with plot armor, he fails just as often. He continuosly fails and makes mistakes that sometimes are absolutely detrimental but he pushes past it all with his admirable tenacity, and sometimes, there are moments in the story where these traits cause Luffy to shine. This is most commonly seen when Luffy fights the corrupt and injustice we see throughout the story which makes us want to cheer him on and makes us want to see him succeed(more on this later).
<p>Luffy isn't the only great character in the cast either. On top of Luffy, it's also extremely entertaining to watch his entire crew interact with one another and the outside world. Each one of these characters have tremendously detailed backstories that strengthens their motivations. What makes the main cast so fun to watch is the how different each one is from one another, and despite that, how well they are able to bounce off of each other. This causes them to feel like a realistic dysfunctional family that manages to pull together anyway, or a chaotic friend group that relies on one another like family. This makes One Piece vastly different from any other anime due to the fact that nearly no other anime is able to show a display of such connection between their main cast like One Piece has. This, of course, is largely due to the sheer length of the series, and how much time we are provided to witness the growth and evolution of each member of the crew. Altogether, this causes the readers to feel a great deal of investment to each one of the Straw Hat Pirates. 
<p>What adds onto the amazing cast of characters even further, is the amount of detail every character gets, not just the main cast. For instance, the supposed "villains" in the story are equally compelling with their own story to tell. Ranging from Crocodile, to Lucci, and all the way to Doflamingo, each one of the antagonists have their own motivations. On top of the villains, there are many side characters who have nearly as detailed stories to tell us as the Straw Hats do. For example, we learn about the entirety of Trafalgar Law's past and explore his story in and out throughout the Dressrosa and Punk Hazard arc. We find out about his connection to the villain of that arc and we learn to care a great deal about Law as much as we would any of the main cast. He's just one example of an amazing side character that would become as beloved as the main characters. 
<p>Here are some of the very important characters that may or may not become very relevant throughout the course of the series:
<p>First the main cast, the Straw Hats:

<h2>The Story</h2>
<a href="https://animesouls.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/One-Piece-Arcs-11.jpg" target="blank">
<img src="img4.jpg" width=350>
</a>
<p>The story is the knot that ties everything together that makes One Piece a masterpiece. What makes the story so great is the constant mystery to be solved and enemy to be defeated. There is almost never a break for you to catch your breath, the story constantly moves forward without any gaps, keeping you constantly engaged and intrigued. What makes this different from other Shounen stories, is how Oda is able to constantly build the current enemies and mysteries on top of the old ones, instead of coming to a complete conclusion to each and every enemy and mystery and having to build new ones up from zero. There is always an overarching important mystery, an overarching enemy, a goal to be aimed towards overall past the small goals which are every story arc. It can actually be amazing and hard it sometimes might be to follow the overarching plot narritives. 
<hr>

<h2>The World Building (World and Buildup)</h2>
<a href="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aH5OHSUpfgU/maxresdefault.jpg" target="blank">
<img src="img5.jpg" width=350>
</a>
<p>The World building is arguably the greatest aspect of the series. The sheer attention to detail that Oda provides is astonishing. He builds up the story in advance, hundreds of chapters earlier. We are provided small bits and pieces of information that might feel small and insignificant until hundreds up chapters later when it suddenly comes very relevant and important. This makes the story feel well put together and gives a huge payoff for the reader for paying attention to the details from countless arcs ago. Altogether, this makes the story feel as if Oda had thought up and put together the entirety of the story way before he even started to work on it. On top of this the world feels completely real because of how it's filled to the brim with the richness of many different diverce races, islands, and the deep history to tie it all together. The corrupted actions of characters that are both in history and happening in real time make the story feel real (more on this later). The diverse huge world makes the story feel as if it could go on even if we weren't following the main cast, that we could still imagine a story to this world even if the main cast wasn't here.  
<p>For example, here is one of the abilities/powers in One Piece that enriches the story, devil fruits. Here are some of the devil fruits that are showcased throughout the story:

<h2>The Believability</h2>
<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/37c35c66-ecb6-423c-a95e-08c415f0d1e1/scale-to-width/755" target="blank">
<img src="img6.jpg" width=350>
</a>
<p>On the topic from earlier, another important aspect of story, is that it's believable. If a story isn't believable enough, or if there is something that feels extremely out of place and awkward to the story, it can put the reader off and take them out of the story for a brief moment. One piece does a great job at making the story feel believable due to the world building mentioned earlier. One major thing that makes the world feel so real is the corruptness presented throughout the story. The world is inherently filled with injustice and corrupt people in power, this gives us a relatability feeling when we look at our own world and how it can be corrupt. The believability of this corrupt nature of the world enhances a character such as Luffy, for example, and it makes us even happier to see him succeed because of how it would be our ideal dream to come to the same result as the world of One Piece.
<hr>
<h2>In Conclusion</h2>
<p>In conclusion, One Piece is one of the greatest series ever made, and compared to other Shounen, it's most certainly one of the best Shounen of all time. It's an excellent example of what a Shounen should be, how to appeal to such a wide audience of younger boys and yet create a story so engaging and intriguing that it when looked at in detail in can also hook in anyone outside of the target demographic. One Piece is a manga that deserves to go down in the history books, in the hall of fame, it's... Peak fiction.
