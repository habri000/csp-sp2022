<p> Stories. They're an endless constant medium that spans across the entire world to connect millions of people to one another regardless of the language barrier. They come in many different forms, from good old fashioned books, to manga, to movies and shows. There are thousands of stories we've seen, both good and bad, but what exactly defines these "good" stories? What do we look for in a story, and what does "peak" fiction really look like?

<p>The characters are one of the most important aspects of a story, and we can see this in full affect in One Piece with some of the fan favorites... and, well, not so favorites. One Piece has a vast array of characters, some more relevant than others. Each of the characters are unique, with different endearing traits. No story is good unless you have a protagonist you can get behind, and One Piece does just this. Monkey D. Luffy, is the hero of our journey. While at first he might give you the impression of an ordinary Shounen anime protagonist, Oda still manages to captivate you with this compelling protagonist regardless of the common tropes. Although Luffy has the common traits of a Shounen protagonist (impulsive, dumb, strong, stubborn), the sheer drive and empathy he displays makes you just want to cheer him on on his ventures. He's different from other Shounen protagonists in the way that he is flawed. Though he often might barrel through the story with plot armor, he fails just as often. He continuosly fails and makes mistakes that sometimes are absolutely detrimental but he pushes past it all with his admirable tenacity, and sometimes, there are moments in the story where he shines like a brilliant diamond.
